# Confirm-Security-Group-access-and-test-UAC

On the Virtual Machine used for assignments 8a and 8b, login as the non-admin account.  Once logged in perform two steps.

Step 1: Create a document, such as a text file, in the AssignmentB folder, confirming the user has been granted access through the security Group.

Step 2: Download and install a simple program, such as Adobe Reader.  Run the installer, which will bring up a UAC prompt.  At this point enter your administrator account credentials to safely install the software.
